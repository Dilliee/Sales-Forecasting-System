Sales Forecasting System
Overview
This Sales Forecasting System is designed to predict future sales based on historical sales data. Utilizing advanced statistical methods, the system analyzes past sales trends to forecast upcoming demands. This tool is intended to assist businesses in planning inventory, optimizing supply chain management, and enhancing decision-making processes by providing accurate and timely sales predictions.

Features
Data Processing: The system includes a robust data preprocessing module that cleans and prepares historical sales data for analysis. This module handles missing values, normalizes data, and converts dates into a usable format for time-series forecasting.

Forecasting Model: At its core, the system uses a Seasonal ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, which is well-suited for handling seasonal variations in sales data. The model is trained on historical data to capture underlying trends and seasonality.

Visualization: The system includes a basic setup for visualizing historical sales data and the corresponding forecasts through line charts, which help in visually assessing the model's performance and the forecast accuracy.

Manual Configuration: Users can manually configure various model parameters, such as the degree of differencing or the seasonal period, to tailor the forecasting model to specific datasets or seasonal patterns.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting-system.git
cd sales-forecasting-system
Install Dependencies:

bash
npm install
Run the Forecasting Model:

bash
npm start
Usage
After setting up the project, you can load your historical sales data into the system. The system will process the input data, apply the forecasting model, and generate future sales predictions along with visualizations of these predictions against historical data.

Current Limitations
The system is currently designed to be run and tested locally, with a focus on single-variable time series data (sales).
Real-time data fetching and API integrations for live forecasting are in progress and will be included in future updates.
Future Enhancements
Integration with a RESTful API to allow real-time data fetching and to enable the system to be used as a backend service for web applications.
Implementation of additional forecasting models and ensemble techniques to improve accuracy.
Development of a comprehensive user interface for easier management and configuration of forecasting parameters.
